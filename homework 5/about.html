    <h1>About the Hero</h1>
    <p>
      Twelve years before the start of the series, the ninja village of
      Konohagakure was attacked by the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox. The village was
      only saved from complete destruction by the actions of Konoha's leader,
      the Fourth Hokage, who sacrificed his life to seal the Nine-Tails into a
      newborn: Naruto Uzumaki. Orphaned by the attack, Naruto grew up shunned by
      most of the villagers, who hated and feared him because of the Nine-Tails
      trapped within him. Unaware of the monster he contained, Naruto longed for
      acknowledgment, and so vowed to one day become the greatest Hokage the
      village had ever seen.

      In the past, Koji explains to Boruto the mechanics of spaceâ€“time ninjutsu.
      Boruto's usage of it appears to be akin to his grandfather's Flying
      Thunder God Technique, which is what Boruto had been referring to it as,
      but is completely separate. Koji suggested Boruto use metal symbols for
      the use of his variant of the technique.
