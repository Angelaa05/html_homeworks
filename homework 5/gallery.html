      Originally, Naruto was a rather inept ninja, failing to graduate from the
      Academy three times. Through sheer determination and training however, his
      skills rapidly improved to defeat strong genin like Neji Hyūga, Gaara, and
      Kabuto Yakushi, earning acknowledgement from all the Sannin for his
      potential. Under various tutelage, Naruto was able to defeat various
      members of Akatsuki, ultimately earning praise from Konohagakure as a
      Hokage-material hero. Naruto's personally defeated various reincarnated
      Kage[58] and jinchūriki during the Fourth Shinobi World War, with many
      believing he was the central key to winning the battle. By adulthood, his
      prowess made him the Seventh Hokage, regarded as the strongest shinobi in
      history and having command of overwhelming jutsu. With the combined might
      of Sasuke Uchiha, noted as his only rival in power, they are said to be
      able to destroy the world. Together, they overpowered Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki
      who absorbed Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki, and pushed Jigen's body to its limit.
      Overall, he could compete against if not defeat world-threatening
      opponents, such as Obito Uchiha, Madara Uchiha, Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, and
      Toneri Ōtsutsuki, as well as fighting at his absolute peak managed to
      overwhelm Isshiki Ōtsutsuki.
