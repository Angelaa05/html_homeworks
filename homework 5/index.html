          Two and a half years have passed since the end of Naruto’s old
          adventures. He has trained hard with Jiraiya-sama and has returned to
          Konoha to reunite with his friends; but Akatsuki, the organization
          that threatened Naruto years before, is on the move again and this
          time Naruto is not the only one in danger. With the powerful Akatsuki
          organization looming ahead of him, Sasuke still missing, and the
          struggle with the beast hidden inside him a continuous battle, will
          Naruto's hard-earned improvements be enough? Join Naruto, Sakura, new
          friends and the rest of the old gang as the action heats up with new
          techniques and stronger enemies.
